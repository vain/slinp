.TH PRESCONTROL 1 "June 2013" "slinp" "PDF presentation tool chest"
.SH NAME
prescontrol \- do a presentation using the slinp tool chest
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBprescontrol\fP [\fB\-l\fP \fILEFT\fP] [\fB\-r\fP \fIRIGHT\fP] \fBFILE\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBprescontrol\fP is the \(lqmain\(rq component of \fBslinp\fP(1) which
glues all the tools together. It is, however, just an example of what
you could do with \fBslinp\fP. Feel free to ditch \fBprescontrol\fP (or
any of the other tools) and implement them any way you like.
.P
\fBprescontrol\fP is a terminal application and thus requires a terminal
attached to it. It will then present you a very minimalistic
\fBncurses\fP(3) TUI showing the current slide number and any notes for
this slide. Use the key bindings as described below. When you quit
\fBprescontrol\fP, all the other tools will be quit as well.
.SH OPTIONS
One of \fBprescontrol\fP's most important features is to show you
previous slides and upcoming slides. By default, \fBprescontrol\fP will
show you one previous slide, the current slide and one upcoming slide.
You can control those numbers using the \fB\-l\fP and \fB\-r\fP
parameters:
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fILEFT\fP
Number of previous slides.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fIRIGHT\fP
Number of upcoming slides.

\fP
.P
\fBpdfinfo\fP(1) from the poppler package is called to retrieve the
number of pages in your document. This will only be done once when
\fBprescontrol\fP starts.
.P
Most importantly, \fBprescontrol\fP will launch several instances of
\fBshowpdf\fP:
.IP \(bu 4
Some preview windows, by default showing the previous slide, the current
slide and the next slide.
.IP \(bu 4
One window that shows the current slide. It is supposed to be moved to
the projector.
.P
\fBprescontrol\fP gives your window manager some hints on those windows.
All \fBshowpdf\fP windows will have a class name of \fBShowpdf\fP. Their
instance names will be unique:
.IP \(bu 4
Preview windows' instance names are of the form \fIa_b_c\fP where
\fIa\fP is the minimum offset, \fIb\fP the maximum offset and \fIc\fP
the offset for this particular window. For example, if you tell
\fBprescontrol\fP to show the previous slide and the following two
slides, then the window showing the current slide will have an instance
name of \fB-1_2_0\fP.
.IP \(bu 4
The projector window will have an instance name of \fBprojector\fP.
.P
You can use a tool like \fBxprop\fP(1) to examine these properties.
.P
\fBprescontrol\fP will run \fBslidenotes\fP and ask it if there are any
notes for the current slide.
.P
Furthermore, \fBstopclock\fP will be launched and attached to
\fBprescontrol\fP. Use the key bindings below to control the stopwatch.
.P
As you may have noticed, you will be lost if you're not using an
intelligent window manager. The source tree of \fBslinp\fP contains a
directory called \fIlayout_example\fP: It contains a simple script that
makes use of \fBwmctrl\fP(1), a layout for the Awesome WM and an
exemplary patch for dwm. Those things are not maintained, though. Again,
their only purpose is to give you an idea of what you could do.
