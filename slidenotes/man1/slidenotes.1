.TH SLIDENOTES 1 "August 2012" "slinp" "PDF presentation tool chest"
.SH NAME
slidenotes \- retrieve notes for a specific slide
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBslidenotes\fP \fIPDFFILE\fP \fIPAGENUMBER\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBslidenotes\fP is given the path to a PDF file and a slide number. It
then must print the notes for this slide on \fBstdout\fP.
.P
\fBslidenotes\fP does not read anything directly from \fIPDFFILE\fP but
looks for a file called \fIPDFFILE.notes\fP. That file is supposed to
contain your notes. It must follow the simple file format described
below.
.P
If \fIPDFFILE.notes\fP does not exist or if there are no notes for the
given page number, then \fBslidenotes\fP prints nothing. Thus, it's safe
to call \fBslidenotes\fP for any filename and any page number.
.P
\fBslidenotes\fP is part of \fBslinp\fP(1).
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
Here's an example of how your notes must look like:
.P
\f(CW
.nf
{{{ 1
Notes for slide number 1.
}}}

{{{ 10
Things to mention on slide number 10.

Whatever.

\fP
.P
A section starts with \fB{{{\fP, followed by one space character and the
page number. A section is ended by a single \fB}}}\fP (no whitespace
allowed). \fBslidenotes\fP prints anything between those two markers as
is. In particular, line breaks are retained.
.P
Note that this format is designed to make use of Vim folding.
