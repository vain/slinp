The layout is as follows:

	+----------+  +----------+  +---------+
	| Previous |  | Current  |  | Next    |
	|    slide |  |    slide |  |   slide |
	+----------+  +----------+  +---------+
	+-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+
	| other | | other | | other | | other |
	+-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+

There's a main column at the top and a slave column at the bottom.
ppres windows have unique class and instance names and they're sorted
according to them. ppres also has a "projector" window which is set to
floating mode so you can easily move it around.

All other windows are tiled in the slave column.

You could use that layout like this:

	awful.layout.set(vain.layout.ppres, tags[1][8])

Or just add it to your `layouts` table.
