The layout is as follows:

	+----------+  +----------+  +---------+
	| Previous |  | Current  |  | Next    |
	|    slide |  |    slide |  |   slide |
	+----------+  +----------+  +---------+
	+-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+
	| other | | other | | other | | other |
	+-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+

There's a main column at the top and a slave column at the bottom.
slinp windows have unique class and instance names and they're sorted
according to them. slinp also has a "projector" window which is set to
floating mode so you can easily move it around.

All other windows are tiled in the slave column.

I can't guarantee that this patch applies cleanly to any specific
version of dwm. But, as you can see, all it does is add another
function. You should be able to deal with this if you're using dwm.
