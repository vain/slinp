If you're using a "primitive" window manager (one that can't be
programmed) you may find it hard to use pdfpres.

This directory cotnains an example of how to manage the showpdf windows
with any EWMH compliant window manager.

I do not intend to maintain these scripts or to add further features.
The sole purpose is to give you an idea of what you could do.
